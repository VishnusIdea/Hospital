<p style="color: black;" >Dr P. Rajanna started the Department of Anesthesiology more than two decades back in 1988, 
at a small operating room at the outpatient complex of PSG Hospitals that functioned on Avinashi road. 
This is the branch of medicine that enables pain free surgical procedures. In 1989, this small but key department,
that had to work in tandem with other surgical departments, shifted to the new hospital premises. 
Initially it had just a single operating room and two tables. In 1990,
it was upgraded with the addition of ultra-modern anaesthesia machines and ventilators and had six operating rooms.</p>
